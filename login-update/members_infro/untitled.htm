<p><left>One of the original members of GWI, Will has enjoyed playing video games since he was a small boy. Still small only being 5'3, but his passion for gaming as only got stronger. He is loyal member to the clan and has shown that since the start. When he is not playing video games he is saving lives in the great state of Texas as a fire man. After putting out fires all day, he comes home and enjoys a nice cold beer and some CoD with his buddies. </a></left><br /></p>
