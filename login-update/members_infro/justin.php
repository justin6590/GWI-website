<p><left>Justin was born to be a gamer, from his first video system, the NES, he fall in love with gaming.
His favorite thing in gaming, was when he found out a sercret or easter egg on his own, before you
could just google how to beat a level or find a rare item. Growing up he always thought he would make 
a career out of gaming but sadly it did not happen for him. After stepping away from gaming in middle school,
so he was not consided a nerd, he focused on sports and a social life. It was not until Call of Duty 4 launched,
when he decided to jump back into the gaming world. Oh, how he missed it and layed waste to the noobs on the servers.
When World at War realesed he was just playing some HC TDM, when he ran into a few gamers like himself. After
playing for a few days together, they decieded to start a clan. This is when GWI was formed. Now it was not 
like your averge clan where they youtubed and streamed their games, it was just more for fun and being able to 
win all the time. Slowly it started to grow and at it peak it had about 55 active members. Now the clan is ran by Justin
and two original members. He enjoys all time of games but his favorite are Shooters and RPGs.</a></left><br /></p>
