<p><left>One of the original members of GWI, Warren has helped the clan stay together, weather
it has been through his leadership or his ability to make any sitution funny, he is the real reason
GWI stuck it out. Warren is one of the older members so he is able to play whenever he wants(Retired Army Ranger). He did not start playing video games until after he left the Army for a more
laid back lifestyle, because he was been in since the age of 18 he now as all the time in the world to play video games. When his not getting headshots online he enjoys taking his boat out and the lake, and fishing for large mouth bass. </a></left><br /></p>
