<p><left>Welcome to Gaming While Intoxicted. First founded back in World at War,
the clan has been going strong since day one. Sure we had people leave and have gone through some
hard times, he stick it out and have now become closer than before. We are just a group
of dudes that enjoy laying waste to anybody that gets in the way. We play anything from core to hardcore,
if we had to choose we would stick with hardcore. One of the leaders of the clan, Justin is in charge 
of the Objective based teams, where Will and Warren ran the Team Death Match group. If you would like to try
out please register on this site and one of the admins will get back to soon to schedule a try-out date.
 Thank you for stopping by,
  If you would like to sign up for a try out for the clan click <a href="/GWI/login-update/register.php">Here</a>. </left><br /> </p>
